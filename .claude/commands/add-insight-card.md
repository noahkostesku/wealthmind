Build or update the InsightCard React component in
frontend/components/InsightCard.tsx.
The card must display:
- Title (bold, prominent)
- Dollar impact badge (green for earn/save, red for avoid)
- Urgency indicator (red = immediate, amber = this_month, blue = evergreen)
- Confidence indicator (muted styling for low confidence)
- Expandable reasoning section (collapsed by default)
- "What you could do" section
- Dismiss button with reason selector (Already done / Not relevant / I disagree)
Use shadcn/ui components. Tailwind only. No inline styles.
