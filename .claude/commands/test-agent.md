Test the LangGraph agent: $ARGUMENTS
Load backend/data/demo_profile.json and backend/data/cra_rules_2024.json,
run the agent with that data, and show me:
1. The raw JSON output
2. How many findings were returned
3. Whether every finding has a derivable dollar figure
4. Any confidence issues
Do not modify any files. Just run and report.
